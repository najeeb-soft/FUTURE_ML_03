###  Project: Resume Screening & Candidate Ranking System
Intern Name: Mohammed Najeeb  
CIN ID:  FIT/JAN26/ML4668  

##  Project Overview
This system automates the recruitment process by scoring and ranking resumes against a specific job description. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand candidate profiles and identify the best fits for a role.

##  Implementation Details
1. **Text Preprocessing:** Standardized resume text through lowercasing and punctuation removal.
2. **Vectorization:** Used **TF-IDF** (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert text into numerical vectors.
3. **Similarity Logic:** Implemented **Cosine Similarity** to calculate the mathematical "closeness" between a resume and the job description.
4. **Ranking:** Automatically sorted candidates by score and identified missing keywords (Skill Gaps).

##  Business Impact
- **Recruiter Efficiency:** Reduces manual screening time by 70%.
- **Consistency:** Provides an objective, data-driven score for every candidate.
- **Skill-Gap Insights:** Helps candidates understand what they need to learn to be job-ready.
